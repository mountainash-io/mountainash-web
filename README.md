## Getting Started - Github Codespaces

To get started with this project on github codespaces, follow these steps:
1. Login to Github

2. Open Codespaces ( Green '<> Code' button -> Codespaces tab -> 'Create codespace on main' ) 

3. Codespaces will start in your browser.
It should automatically detect that this is a node project and install dependencies.
Try running `pnpm run dev`. If this does not run, run the following to install all dependecies:
```
nvm install 20
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
```

4. Once the codespace is set up, and dependencies are installed, run the following to start the development web server and see a live view of the website:
```
pnpm run dev
```

When the dev website launches you may need to click on the link to '/mountainash-web'

## Getting Started - Local VSCode

This will be a little more involved, as it will require the installation of node and astro

1. Install node ecosystem dependencies
On a mac or linux, open a terminal.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Install Project dependencies
On a mac or linux, open a terminal and go to the project root.
```
pnpm install
```

3. Run Dev server
```
pnpm run dev
```

## Development

- All Astro files are located in the `/src` directory.
- To create a new page, add a new `.astro` file in the `/src/pages` directory.
- Components can be found and added in the `/src/components` directory.
- Styles are managed using Tailwind CSS. The configuration file is `tailwind.config.cjs`.


This command sets the `GITHUB_REF_NAME` to your current git branch name.

## Deployment

This website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process is managed by the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

To deploy changes:

1. Make your changes locally and commit them.
2. Push the changes to the main branch on GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```
3. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy the site.
4. Once completed, your changes will be live at `https://mountainash-io.github.io/mountainash-web/`

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with dependencies, try removing the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file and running `pnpm install` again.
- For deployment issues, check the Actions tab in the GitHub repository for error logs.
